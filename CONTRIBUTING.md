# Contributing to HSE

We are currently focused on collaborating with the Linux community
to get HSE and mpool upstream, and are not able to accept contributions
at this time.
However, see the [HSE Wiki](https://github.com/hse-project/hse/wiki)
for how you can report a bug, make a feature request, provide feedback,
or ask a question.
