# Licenses

## curl

We build curl to get a statically-linkable libcurl.  This is for convenience
since it has not always been simple to get a compatible libcurl on some
older platforms.

Libcurl uses an [MIT style license](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html)
that is very liberal.

## libyaml

Libyaml is a BSD-style license.  Public domain with a copyright notice
requirement.

## liblz4

The lz4 repo is dual BSD/GPLv2 licensed.  We only use the "lib" component
which is completely covered by the BSD 2-Clause license.
