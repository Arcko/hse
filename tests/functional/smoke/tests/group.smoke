# These mpool tests needs to be integrated with the smoke
# framework post config refactor work:
#
#   mcache-test
#   mdc-test
#   kmt-mpool
#
# These tests disabled until WAL is back:
#
#   kvt-logreplay
#   c1-correctness
#
# These tests started failing around 2021-03-10:
#
#   cursor_test1
#   txn_thrash
#
# These tests also fail, not sure when they started to fail:
#
#   prefix-spill
#   prefix-pivot
#   ptree-test
